            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                This project focused on designing a motorized trash container capable of automated lifting and dumping.
                The goal was to develop an efficient waste-handling system that reduces human effort while maintaining high load capacity and operational reliability.
                The design involved mechanical modeling, load analysis, and motion testing to ensure smooth operation and high efficiency.

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                The container features a motorized arm mechanism controlled by a programmable system.
                The lifting mechanism was modeled in SolidWorks and tested under simulated loading conditions.
                Key considerations included structural strength, motor torque requirements, and failure resistance under heavy load.

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                A key challenge was ensuring that the lifting arm maintained stability under high loads.
                This was addressed by adjusting the torque distribution and reinforcing structural joints.
                The final design demonstrated consistent performance and reliability under stress testing.
